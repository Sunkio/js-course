# First Code Challenge

The task is to create a function that takes a name-string as a parameter and returns a random letter from this string.

## My Approach
It wasn't required, but I added user input from the command line to make it easier and more fun to use. To allow the use of all sorts of (creative) usernames, I did not restrict the type of characters the user can enter. The program will return a random letter from the name-string, regardless of whether it is a letter or a number or a special character.

## How to use it
1) Follow the general instructions from the main README.md
2) cd into the js-6_code-challenge folder
3) Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
node js/main.js
```
4) Enter a name-string when prompted
5) The program will return a random letter from the name-string
6) Enjoy! :)
